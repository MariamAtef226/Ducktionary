### Pre-requisites ‚ùî
- Windows operating system.
- Make sure you download all the files in this repo (.exe, .txt and .png) and all of them should exist in the same folder (directory) so that the application would work.

### How to use :question:
- Run the .exe file
- Enter the word you'd like to know its meaning
- The application will display its definition as long as it's spelled correctly and it's an actual english word.
- Else, it'll display to you ``` SORRY, WORD DOESN'T EXIST IN DICTIONARY!  ```
- Also, if the .txt or the .png file isn't find in the same directory as the .exe file, it won't work.
